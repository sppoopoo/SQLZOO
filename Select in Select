1.List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.
-->select name from world where population >(select population from world where name ='Russia'); 

2.Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.
-->select name from world where gdp/population > (select gdp/population from world where name = 'United Kingdom') and continent ='Europe';

3.List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.
-->select name, continent from world where continent in(select continent from world where name in('Argentina', 'australia')) order by name;

4.Which country has a population that is more than United Kingdom but less than Germany? Show the name and the population.
-->select name, population from world where population > (select population from world where name = 'united kingdom') and population <(select population from world where name ='Germany');

5.Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.
-->select name, concat(round(population*100/(select population from world where name ='Germany'),0),'%') as percentage from world where continent ='Europe';

6.Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)
-->select name from world where gdp > all(select gdp from world where continent='Europe'and gdp>0);

7.Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:
-->select continent, name, area from world x where area >= all(select area from world y where x.continent=y.continent and area>0);

8.List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
-->select continent , name from world a where name =(select min(name) from world b where a.continent =b.continent);

9.Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.
-->select name, continent, population from world where continent in(select continent from world group by continent having max(population) <=25000000);

10.Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.
-->select name, continent from world a where population > all(select population *3 from world b where a.continent=b.continent and a.name <>b.name);
