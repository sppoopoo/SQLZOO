1.List the teachers who have NULL for their department.
-->select name from teacher where dept is null;

2.Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.
-->select teacher.name as teacher , dept.name as dept from teacher inner join dept on teacher.dept = dept.id;

3.Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.
--> select teacher.name , dept.name from teacher left  join dept on teacher.dept = dept.id;

4.Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.
-->select teacher.name , dept.name from teacher right join dept on teacher.dept = dept.id;
